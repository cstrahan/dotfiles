fzf
===

Sets up the Zsh shell integration for [fzf].

The following should be removed from your `~/.zshrc`, since this module will
already take care of it:

```zsh
source <(fzf --zsh)
```

Also configures [fzf] to use [bfs], [fd], [ripgrep] or [ugrep] for faster
fetching of files and directories names.

Sets ALT-C previews with ls. Also sets CTRL-T previews with [bat] if it's
installed. Press CTRL-/ to toggle the preview.

Requirements
------------

[fzf] >= 0.48.0 must be installed. And either [bfs], [fd], [ripgrep] or [ugrep]
must be installed already too.
